Author
Jae Ncube

Description
This project is a collection of exercises focused on learning and practicing ES6 (ECMAScript 6) features in JavaScript. Each file contains a specific task along with its implementation using ES6 syntax.

File Structure
0-constants.js: Modifies the instantiation of variables to use const and let instead of var.
1-block-scoped.js: Updates the variables inside a function to prevent them from being overwritten within a conditional block.
2-arrow.js: Rewrites a function to use ES6's arrow syntax.
3-default-parameter.js: Modifies a function to use default parameter values for its parameters.
4-rest-parameter.js: Rewrites a function to use the rest parameter syntax to determine the number of arguments passed to it.
5-spread-operator.js: Concatenates arrays and a string using spread syntax.
6-string-interpolation.js: Rewrites a function to use template literals for string interpolation.
7-getBudgetObject.js: Modifies a function to use key names as property names in an object.
8-getBudgetCurrentYear.js: Updates a function to use computed property names on an object.
9-getFullBudget.js: Rewrites a function to use ES6 method properties.
10-loops.js: Updates a function to use ES6's for...of loop instead of for...in.
11-createEmployeesObject.js: Creates an object with departments and employees.
12-createReportObject.js: Generates a report object with department-wise employee lists and a method to get the number of departments.
