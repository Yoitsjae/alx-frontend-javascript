## Overview
This repository contains JavaScript files implementing various tasks related to ES6 Promises. Each task focuses on different aspects of promises, such as creation, resolution, rejection handling, chaining, and error handling.

## Tasks
1. **Keep every promise you make and only make promises you can keep**
   - File: 0-promise.js
   - Return a Promise using a specific prototype function.

2. **Don't make a promise...if you know you can't keep it**
   - File: 1-promise.js
   - Return a promise based on a boolean argument.

3. **Catch me if you can!**
   - File: 2-then.js
   - Append handlers to a Promise and handle resolution and rejection.

4. **Handle multiple successful promises**
   - File: 3-all.js
   - Resolve multiple promises and handle errors collectively.

5. **Simple promise**
   - File: 4-user-promise.js
   - Return a resolved promise with specific data.

6. **Reject the promises**
   - File: 5-photo-reject.js
   - Return a rejected promise with specific error message.

7. **Handle multiple promises**
   - File: 6-final-user.js
   - Handle multiple promises and return an array of results.

8. **Load balancer**
   - File: 7-load_balancer.js
   - Return the result of the fastest resolving promise.

9. **Throw error / try catch**
   - File: 8-try.js
   - Implement a function to divide numbers safely.

10. **Throw an error**
    - File: 9-try.js
    - Implement a function to guardrail a given math function.

11. **Await / Async**
    - File: 100-await.js
    - Implement an async function to handle multiple async operations and return results.

## Usage
To test each task, run the corresponding JavaScript file using Node.js. For example:
